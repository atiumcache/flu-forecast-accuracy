# Determing Accuracy for Flu Forecasting

This program aims to determine the forecasting accuracy for various disease prediction methods.

We are currently using MCMC and Particle Filter algorithms to predict the future flu hospitalization rates, based on past hospitalization data. 

We want to compare the forecasting accuracy between these prediction methods. 

## How can we determine accuracy? 

We are utilizing a Weighted Interval Score (WIS) outlined in the following paper:
